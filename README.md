Problem Statement
The citizen awareness about the impact of new laws and amendment of the current laws, is minimal. Only a very small group of people take decisions that affect the complete country population. The reason for low awareness is because of the high number of laws and petitions and most of these are not relevant for everybody. If a typical citizen is looking to be informed about this, he needs to spend huge amount time and go through several documents.

Proposed Solution
We would like to improve the citizen participation providing awareness to the each an every individual citizen about the new laws and amendments that can affect directly to him/her. We will provide a mechanism that will use the personal information of the individual along with the profile, social data, financial data and any additional source of information in order to get the attributes that will be used to identify if a specific law is affecting him/her, with awareness the citizen can take an action. Letâ€™s meet KEN!
